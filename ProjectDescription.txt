This project is a modification of the github repo https://github.com/machadop1407/react-personal-portfolio-website by pedrotech.
I added more features which includes:
- Adding hilight feature in the navigation bare
- Links to my email, instagram and linkedin
- Adding icons to the footer
- Changing the CSS of the home page to make it more of my prefered design
- Added CSS file to the Learning Journey to make it more of my preffered design
- Fix the rendering problem of the website, so that it can be viewed both from computer and mobile
- Further refining the project page by adding github links to the github icon
